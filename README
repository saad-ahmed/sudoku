To run the solver:

    python runsudoku.py <filename>

You can then enter a sudoku board 1 line at a time using the suggested format.
(It doesn't attempt to validate input.)

<filename> is optional: additional logging will be done to that file if it
is present.


solver.py contains the code for actually solving a sudoku board
sudoku.py contains the code that defines and manipulates a sudoku board
puzzle.py contains code for loading in ~11,000 sudoku puzzles from 'puzzles', 
generated using the debian program 'sudoku'

To run the solver manually on imported puzzles:

	import sudoku as s
	import solver as sol
	import puzzles as puz
	puzzles = puz.load_puzzles('puzzles')
	ps = puzzles['medium'][:10]
	count = 0
	for p in ps:
		b = s.Board(p)
		bs = sol.solve(b)
		if bs.is_solved(): count += 1
	print count # the number of correct puzzles

(Printing a 'Board' object will pretty-print a sudoku board.)
